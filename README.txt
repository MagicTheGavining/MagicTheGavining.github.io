This is a start of what is a portfolio website with the purpose of showing what I can do in JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS.

My goals are:
-Make all parts of the web page scale up or down to look good on anything from an UHD screen down to a flip phone screen both in ProcessingJS and JQuery
-Build ProcdessingJS JavaScript that is robust and handles any input the user throws at it
-Make the entire website navigatable with a constant <div> of buttons at the top
-Make the entire website change themes to show a variety of CSS options

As of 5/10/2020, I have just a few html files up and running, I will include the header comments of my code here:

Key:- means subtraction/deletion from code
	+ means addition of code/functionality
